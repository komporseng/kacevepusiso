Kathryn’s mother shared a short story about her parents on her Facebook which was dedicated to Kathryn’s paternal grandfather Joe Dickerson Sr. She wrote, “Dating my husband (in Atlanta) after our UT Knoxville school days meant I didn’t know his family well at all. On visits to Knoxville– which were overnighters, of course, I found to break the nerves of awkwardness… I would just dive into whatever they were doing around the house and help out. It was my way to connect and have a conversation about things they were interested in such as his workshop or her cooking or his birdfeeder refills…etc.”</p><p>She continued, “One day Joe P. slung his arm around my shoulders and said… “Do you know what I like about you? You are a Do-er! I like that. That’s a good thing.”I thought hmmm … well good! hahaha, I’ve thought about that many times since. I can now recognize the doers in the world and find myself wanting to line up with those people!!”</p><p>Kathryn lost her paternal grandfather a while back but hasn’t revealed anything about him.</p><p>As for her mom, Susan Dickerson currently works as a health, wellness, nutritional cleansing coach and entrepreneur at Isagenix.

Getting to know film directors, casting directors, agents, photographers, fellow actors and parents who have been in support of this “dream”…has brought a whole new level of appreciation in realizing what it takes to bringing a creative thought to paper to the camera to the screen.”</p><p>Kathryn grew up in Atlanta, Georgia where she currently lives.
