Fans of the show were introduced to Max on season 2 of the TLC show. By season three, when they were about to move in together, he handed the reality star a promise ring, and things really started to heat up.</p><p>In August 2021, Moriah gushed about her then-boyfriend to US Weekly saying, “He’s a really likable person. He’s so happy —and he’s kind of a problem solver instead of a problem creator. … I feel so lucky too with all the drama, all the differences in my family, [that I] have found somebody [who] my family has ever had a problem with.”</p><p>“It was a big milestone for being a one-year and we both just kind of wanted to make it special,” Moriah told the outlet in August 2021 of the gift. “We did something special for each of each other.” At the time, Moriah noted that she’s “discovered so much about myself in this relationship” after she was scared to “let anybody in.”</p><p>Moreover, in the following season, Max presented Moriah with a promise ring which meant that things were serious between the two. However, by October 2021 the rumor sparked that the pair who had planned to move to Tampa were no longer together. Three months after the rumored split, Moriah released a song that further confirmed the end of the pair’s romance.</p><p>Eventually, Max was the one who ended up confirming the split via a video on YouTube. He shared in the video that he had “cross[ed] several boundaries” with another woman.</p><p>“So, a couple of weeks after I moved to Tampa, Max called me one night and just said he made a mistake,” Moriah clarified on the season 4 premiere. “I’m not going to go into details. Since then, I have been in a dark place. … It hurts really bad, especially when you think that you found the one and you had all of these plans of forever, and it turns out to not be true.”</p><p>The reality star continued: “It made me feel worthless for sure. It made me feel like I had poured everything that I had of my heart to be treated like I could just be traded for anything.”</p><h3><strong>Max Kallschmidt Wife</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Max Kallschidt to his soon-to-be-wife <a href=#>Mckayle Buckley</a>.
