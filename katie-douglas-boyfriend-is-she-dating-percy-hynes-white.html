Katie began at the age of six and has been a part of the buzz for long enough that people are beginning to probe into other aspects of her life, specifically her love life or partner.</p><p>Speaking of which, the actress was recently linked to Wednesday actor Percy Hynes-White, but others claim they are already married. It has piqued people’s interest for quite some time. But what lies behind the surface? Discover more in the following article.</p><h2><span id=The_Real_Story_of_Katie_Douglas_and_Percy_Hynes-White8217s_Relationship_Did_Douglas_Date_Hynes-White>The Real Story of Katie Douglas and Percy Hynes-White’s Relationship; Did Douglas Date Hynes-White?</span></h2><p>Katie has recently been bombarded with queries about her connection with Wednesday actor and fellow Canadian artist Percy Hynes-White. And, to be honest, the two had caused a few love indications in the past.</p><p>While there are some questionable tweets and photos, the actress has never given a conclusive response as to what was really going on behind the scenes between her and Hynes White. Both did an admirable job of keeping their private lives private.</p><p>However, according to some fans, Katie and Percy’s somewhat hypothesized could-have-been relationship has already ended. In fact, according to some hooked fans, Katie revealed she was single during one of her Instagram Q&As, which occurred just after the split rumors between her and Hynes White surfaced.</p><p>Katie and Percy split up in April 2022, according to one TikTok video. In any case, the relationship was never made public.</p><p>Hynes-White, Douglas’ rumored ex-boyfriend, has appeared in films and television shows such as Our House, Age of Summer, Pretty Hard Cases, Edge of Winter, and The Gifted.</p><h2><span id=Rumors_of_a_Percy_Hynes-White_romance_with_The_Wednesday_actress_Jenna_Ortega>Rumors of a Percy Hynes-White romance with The Wednesday actress Jenna Ortega</span></h2><p>Since his chapter with Douglas ended, White has sparked new relationship speculations, this time with his Wednesday co-star Jenna Ortega. In the current Netflix series, the couple had enthralling on-screen chemistry.</p><p>The true implications that gave this notion credence came when Hynes White released a collage on Instagram in which the actor and the Wednesday lead star showed some close admiration for each other. Since then, there has been a lot of speculation about whether they are dating or not.</p><p>Similarly to the Douglas and White dilemma, the question of whether the latter is actually dating Ortega is a vexing enigma. Despite fans’ portrayal of the co-stars as an ideal pair, there hasn’t been a single evidence of flirty dynamics between them thus far.</p><h2><span id=Katie_Douglas_is_gaining_popularity_on_Instagram>Katie Douglas is gaining popularity on Instagram.</span></h2><p>Douglas, in addition to her numerous acting credentials, has a rapidly growing Instagram following. Katie, who is only 24 years old, already has over 500,000 followers on her image-sharing site. While most of the entries are abstract in nature, her moblog is still scrollable and has a plethora of photographs, including behind-the-scenes information from her acting career.<br>Is There Anything On Katie Douglas’s Social Media About Her Boyfriend?</p><p>Douglas doesn’t have much of a story in this sense, based solely on her social media posts. Katie has been keeping the situation behind closed doors hidden from her internet fans while sharing a series of her photos.</p><p>However, just one name appears to be worth mentioning in this regard. It first emerged in 2017 when Douglas shared a fairly mysterious yet subtle image on her Instagram, which the actress has yet to remove. While the youngster in the picture (Dan Schnurr) may be anyone in her personal circle, the actress’ caption for the image doesn’t rule him out as one of her reported ex-boyfriends.</p><p>As a result, the inscription that came with the image stated,</p><p>He’s finally home, which means I’m home as well.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was a few years ago and the claimed pair may have broken up since, Douglas, as previously stated, has not erased the post. Dan and Katie continue to follow each other on Instagram. Dan, whose Ig is private, graduated from the University of Ottawa in 2020.</p><p>As of today, Douglas, who stands roughly five feet tall, appears to be single and choosing to stand alone, at least for the time being (apparently). But, again, only time will tell what’s going on in her DMs surrounding the matter.</p><p>Despite appearing in multiple interviews and being extremely open on social media, Katie has yet to reveal who her romantic interest is or was. To be honest, the ABCs of her relationship dealings have been completely a premium subject.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Canadian actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Tracey Ashley I Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>A well-known stand-up comedian, actress, writer, and social media user is Tracey Ashley.
