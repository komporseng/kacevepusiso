Just like the title suggests </span><i><span>NLC </span></i><span>took three teams, who competed on three levels of a massive three-story kitchen for a prize of a quarter of a million dollars.</span></p><p><span>The top-level which included the best line gadget and gizmo a cook could ever wish for was mentored by judge Nyesha Arrington. The middle level, with an essentially equipped standard kitchen, was handed by Richard Blais. And the Basement Level, which only received the leftovers, was undoubtedly chef Gordon Ramsay’s.</span></p><p><span>As seen on the first ep, the 15 contestants were split into groups of five and sent to different levels of the kitchen. So, after each of them cooked and presented their dishes, the selection began. Well, Sergio who poorly cooked a salmon on the top floor! and Courtney, a personal chef cooking in The Basement, were the final two left to be picked.</span></p><p><span>And to everyone’s surprise, chef Nyesha decided to give Sergio a second chance and took him into her team.</span></p><p><span>Given his arrogance and vanity, many were certain that he would be the next to go home.</span></p><p><span>Joining Sergio in this inaugural season were chefs —&nbsp; Zachary Adams, Reuel Vincent, Amber Rebold, Mariah Scott, Jonathan Harrison, Kenny Everett, Ae Southammavong, Angie Ragan, Courtney Brown, <a href=#>Tricia Wang</a>, Roice Bethel, Gary Marandola, Stephanie “Pyet” DeSpain, and Devonnie Black.</span></p><p><span>Recalling his time on the show, Sergio shared that it was an “honestly unreal experience.” Also, he explained himself to a “beast in the kitchen that can keep a two-man station running by (himself) at 7:30 no problem.” Guess that explains his arrogancy.</span></p><h3><b>Sergio Steele Age</b></h3><p><span>Sergio Steele was 34 years of age when he first appeared on </span><i><span>Next Level Chef</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Is Sergio Steele On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, as of January 2022, find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>sergio.steele</span></a><span> with over 800 followers.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>sergio.steele</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Sergio Steele Wife</b></h3><p><span>Sergio Steele’s soon-to-be wife is Sarah Rivera.

As per Sergio, he popped the question in “the best place possible” in Montego Bay, Jamacia after sharing their “favorite activities — snorkeling, good food, and exploring the Caribbean.”</span></p><p><span>We have no idea when the duo plans to get married.</span></p><p><span>However, we do know that the lovebirds were so in love as of 2022. And some of Sergio’s love for his future wife was also reflected in his IG posts. Over a post, Sergio wrote, “I’m beyond proud to call you my fiancé and counting down until you’re officially my wife. I love you.”</span></p><p><span>Sarah celebrates her birthday on October 4.
