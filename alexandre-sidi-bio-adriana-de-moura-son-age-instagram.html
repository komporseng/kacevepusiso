Then, according to Adriana’s statement, Robert choked her into submission and raped her while young son Alexandre was asleep in the room next door.</p><p>Robert, meanwhile, had denied all of Adriana’s claims in his court paper filings but agreed in 2008 to return primary custody of Alexandre to his mother.</p><p>And when Star reached out to Adriana for more, she had said: <span>“The court papers speak for themselves. Whatever I went through in my marriage and afterward, I said enough on the show.

And that, she and her new husband had decided to tie the knot again after Alexandre accepted him as his father.</p><p>Fast forward to some years and they have now parted ways.</p><p>Newly single Adriana opened up about her relationship status following her split from Frederic in 2020 while appearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on 6 May 2021.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Alexandre Sidi Father?</strong></h3><p>Alexandre Sidi’s father Robert Sidi is the founder of Orlando Motorsports, the largest automobile entertainment center built in the United States.</p><p>The Rio de Janeiro native has worked as an entrepreneur in F1 and also in the Sportswear sector, having the products sold at more than 20 thousand points of sale between the United States and Mexico.</p><p>He also founded the largest North-American prepaid fixed telephone company, Alpha Ventures M&A boutique.</p><p>Other than that the billionaire has also raised funding to mineral, retail, real estate, and technology companies.</p><p>Robert graduated in International Business from Southern Methodist University in Texas, lived in 12 countries, and learned to speak in 5 languages.</p><h3><strong>Alexandre Sidi Age</strong></h3><p>Before October 2021, Alexandre Sidi had reached the age of 20.</p><h3><strong>Alexandre Sidi Job</strong></h3><p>Alexandre Sidi is an heir to his parents’ multiple-million net worth.</p><p>His mother, who also appeared in the 2018 movie Apollyon had a net worth of $10 million in 2018.</p><p>Back in 2018, Alexandre was a Freshman planning on studying International Relations at the University of Miami Sailing.</p><p>A year before that, Alexandre was a captain of the sailing team at Ransom Everglades Athletics.
