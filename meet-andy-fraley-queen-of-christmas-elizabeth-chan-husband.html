Now, we shall also remember her as someone who blocked Mariah Carey’s attempt to trademark the honorific, as well as the songbird’s concurrent attempts to register the trademarks “Princess Christmas” and “Queen of Christmas”. Elizabeth always thought that it was wrong for an individual to attempt to own and monopolize a nickname like Queen of Christmas for the purposes of abject materialism, and now even the court has sided with her. With all these things happening in Elizabeth Chan’s life, people also have been more than ever curious about her husband Andy Fraley. So, we are here to tell you all about him.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Andy Fraley, “Queen Of Christmas” Elizabeth Chan’s Husband</strong></h3><p>Elizabeth Chan’s Christmas albums are distinctive in that they are an autobiographical snapshot of where she is on her journey with her husband Andy Fraley. She revealed this herself in 2019, the year she celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary with him. This, Elizabeth discussed as she released her Christmas album for the year. She claimed this album was a nod to her husband and their 10 years together.</p><p>Of course, this was not the only time the “Queen of Christmas” specifically recorded songs for her husband, or gushed about him on social media. On 1 January 2022, in a letter that she wrote to the year as the countdown began, she mentioned that with Andy, she had the honor to celebrate New Years Eve’s and all kinds of celebrations for almost 15 years. She also expressed that she loves their time and life together and looks forward to many years with her best friend.</p><p>The couple has been together since at least 2007 and over the years have welcomed two kids into their lives.</p><p>The eldest is Noelle a.k.a the Princess of Christmas and crafts, according to her Instagram account @princessofxmas. Noelle, as per its BIO, is a recording artist/singer. Speaking of her age, she was born in 2016. Some five years later and her mother actually dedicated an entire album to her, called “Songs for Noelle”.</p><p>At the start of the pandemic, Elizabeth again found out that she was pregnant with her second child. And though at the time she was not quite sure what life would bring, today she says she really could not imagine her world without her daughters.</p><p>As a mom, she expected to teach things to her children. But the last 2 years, she said, they have taught her so much about what is important in life and have made her a better mother and woman.</p><p>Undoubtedly, through this process of raising the young ones, Andy has been of great help to his wife. So much so that Elizabeth wrote this on her social media lately, “Some people are fathers and some are just meant to be great dads. Andy is a great one. #happyfathersday to everyone!”</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Andy Fraley Age</strong></h3><p>Andy’s full name is Marydelle T King and he was reportedly born in 1945. Based on this, he should be 77 years old by 2022. But, he definitely does not look that age.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Andy Fraley Family</strong></h3><p>Family background is another aspect of Andy Fraley’s life that remains to be disclosed publicly. We can only tell you that he is the son of Robin M. Williams of Falls Church, Va., and Mark T. Fraley of Silverhill, Alabama.</p><p>We can also tell you a few things about his in-laws Aileen Isidro Chan and Wayne Chan of New York. Mark is seemingly a lawyer working as an account executive at Legacy Consulting in Silverhill, Alabama area. As for the mother-in-law, she has had a career as an outdoor classroom curriculum coordinator/supervisor at Falls Church City Public Schools.</p><p>Elizabeth’s grandparents came to the States from the Philippines with very little. They were from a poor town and having to figure out a way to feed their 8 children, and encourage them to find their way to America, took more than just money. To persevere through the insurmountable odds, Elizabeth’s words, they thought to be rich in faith. So, they were armed with the belief that better times will come and they sure did.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Andy Fraley On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Andy Fraley was not on Instagram or any other social media platforms as of 17 November 2022. But, he certainly could be seen now and then on his wife’s Instagram <a style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em href=#>@lizchanmusic</a>&nbsp;and other platforms.</p><p>Elizabeth also occasionally showed him on her <a href=#>Facebook</a> among her more than 75K followers.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Andy Fraley Job</strong></h3><p>At 31, when Andy Fraley was getting married to 28-year-old Elizabeth in New York, he was working as an art director for AOL. He had also graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology, not long ago.</p><p>Fast forward to today, Andy has naturally had growth and found a better position for himself. It appears he has been the Assistant Vice President, and Associate Creative Director at Morgan Stanley for some time now. Morgan Stanley is a firm that mobilizes capital to help governments, corporations, institutions, and individuals around the world achieve their financial goals.</p><p>Andy has had a career also as a senior user experience designer at Time Inc., and as a senior designer/graphic designer at&nbsp;Dow Jones.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>When Is Andy Fraley’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Andy Fraley’s birthday is on March 16th and that makes him a Pisces.</p><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>Where Is Andy Fraley From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As per the reports available on the internet, Andy Fraley hails from Selma, a city in the Black Belt region of south central Alabama and extending to the west.</p><ul><li><h4 style=text-align:left><strong>How Tall Is Andy Fraley?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Andy Fraley stands above 5’10” in height.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpp2VqXqiusOyZJ%2BqkaGyunnQrpyepl2ks26vx6ugrKydlsBuscuisZqalam1bq%2FHmqVmoKWor6K6w2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./merle-haggard.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Merle Haggard?
