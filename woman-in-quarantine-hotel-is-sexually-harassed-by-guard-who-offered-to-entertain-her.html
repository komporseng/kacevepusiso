escorted outside on exercise breaks by male guards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Guests are allowed to leave their room once a day for exercise but must be accompanied by guards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Farmer told the BBC that during their exercise breaks, another guard had also made lewd comments to female guests.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also claimed that while she was cleaning her room, the guard said:&nbsp;‘Why don’t you put that Hoover down and I’ll come in and entertain you.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said the security guard then repeated this request another five times within the space of just 10 minutes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Farmer said the guard was removed when she complained to the head of the security team in the hotel, and she also reported the harassment to&nbsp;Northamptonshire police.</p><img decoding=async id=i-85ba5d44bc227dec
